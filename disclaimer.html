                </p>

                <h2>1. General Information</h2>
                <p>
                    The information, tools, and services provided on Word Counter (the "Website") are for general 
                    informational and educational purposes only. While we strive to provide accurate and reliable 
                    word counting functionality, we make no representations or warranties of any kind, express or 
                    implied, about the completeness, accuracy, reliability, suitability, or availability of the 
                    Website or the information, tools, or services contained on the Website.
                </p>

                <h2>2. Tool Accuracy and Usage</h2>
                
                <h3>2.1 Counting Accuracy</h3>
                <p>
                    Word Counter uses standard word counting algorithms that follow widely accepted conventions. However:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Different platforms and software may use slightly different word counting methods</li>
                    <li>Special characters, symbols, and formatting may be counted differently</li>
                    <li>Results may vary depending on language, character set, and text structure</li>
                    <li>The tool is designed for standard text and may not handle all edge cases perfectly</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    <strong>For critical submissions</strong> (academic papers, professional documents, publications), 
                    we recommend verifying word counts using the official counting tool or method specified by your 
                    institution, publisher, or organization.
                </p>

                <h3>2.2 Informational Purposes Only</h3>
                <p>
                    Word Counter is provided as a convenience tool for informational purposes. It should not be relied 
                    upon as the sole method for determining word counts in situations where precise accuracy is legally 
                    or contractually required.
                </p>

                <h2>3. Limitation of Liability</h2>
                <p>
                    To the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, Word Counter, its operators, developers, and 
                    affiliates shall not be liable for any direct, indirect, incidental, consequential, special, or 
                    punitive damages, including but not limited to:

                <ul>

                </ul>
                <p>
                    This limitation applies whether the alleged liability is based on contract, tort, negligence, 
                    strict liability, or any other basis, even if Word Counter has been advised of the possibility 
                    of such damages.
